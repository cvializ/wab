## What is Weight and Balance?

> The center of gravity of an aircraft is the point at which the aircraft would balance if it were possible to suspend it at that point. It is the theoretical point at which the entire weight of the aircraft is assumed to be concentrated

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_and_balance)


> Compliance with the weight and balance limits of any aircraft
is critical to flight safety. Operating above the maximum
weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of
an aircraft and adversely affects its performance. Operation
with the center of gravity (CG) outside the approved limits
results in control difficulty

## Select an Aircraft

When you visit the W&B page, an aircraft's data will already be loaded.
To select a different aircraft to load, click the dropdown at the top.

## Load the Aircraft

You'll see that some default values are already present.
However, you should enter the data for *your specific airplane* and *your specific flight load*.

## Calculate the Weight and Balance

As values are entered, the graph changes to note the position of the aircraft's
Center of Gravity. The CG moves when each load is added.

The final, fully-loaded CG can be found at the tip of the 'Weight and Balance' line of the graph.

If the CG is outside the Normal Category envelope, the line will turn red.
